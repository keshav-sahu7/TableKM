        <h3> What is a View? </h3>
        <p>
            View offers a virtual table, that is a read only table with specific rows and columns filtered using formula. It is light weight
            as it doesn't make any copy of original data. Sorting order and sorting column of the root table (original table) can not be altered
            once it is set (during creation of the table) and it sorts using the first column. But that is not the case with Views as sorting
            order and sorting column can be changed any time.
        </p>
        <h3> Creating a View </h3>
        <p>
             To create a view, you must have a table opened. When you have a table, right click on it and from menu click <i>Create View</i>.
